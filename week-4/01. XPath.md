**XPath** is a query language that is used for traversing through an XML document. It is used commonly to search particular elements or attributes with matching patterns.

A **node** is any item within the tree structure of the document.
A collection of nodes is called a **node set**.

## Nodes

XPath specification specifies seven types of nodes which can be the output of execution of the XPath expression:

- Root node
- Element node
- Text node
- Attribute node
- Comment node
- Processing-Instruction node
- Namespace node

### Node tree

Various nodes from the source document are organized into a **node tree**, with the **root node** or **document node** at the top of the tree.

**Element node** refers to an element from the source document

**Attribute node** refers to an elementâ€™s attribute

## Syntax

| Expression  | Description                                                     |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `node-name` | Select all nodes with the given name "nodename"                 |
| `/`         | Selection starts from the root node                             |
| `//`        | Selection starts from the current node that match the selection |
| `.`         | Selects the current node                                        |
| `..`        | Selects the parent of the current node                          |
| `@`         | Selects attributes                                              |

Location path specifies the location of node in XML document. This path can be **absolute** or **relative**. If location path starts with root node or with '/' then it is an absolute path.

### Examples

| Expression        | Description                                                                                                                       |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `bookstore`       | Select all nodes with the name "bookstore"                                                                                        |
| `/bookstore`      | Select the root element bookstore Note: If the path starts with a slash ( / ) it always represents an absolute path to an element |
| bookstore//book   | Select all book elements that are children of bookstore                                                                           |
| `//book`          | Select all book elements no matter where they are in the document                                                                 |
| `bookstore//book` | Select all book elements that are descendant of the bookstore element, no matter where they are under the bookstore element       |
| `//@lang`         | Select all attributes that are named lang                                                                                         |

## Predicate

**Predicates** are used to find a specific node or a node that contains a specific value.

**Predicates** are always embedded in square brackets.

```xml
/element1/element2[predicate]
```

### Example

Select the first book element that is the child of the bookstore element:

```xml
/bookstore/book[1]
```

Select all the title elements that have a "lang" attribute with a value of "en"

```xml
//title[@lang='en']
```
