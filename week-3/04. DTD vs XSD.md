# DTD vs XSD

A schema is an XML document that contains validation rules for an XML vocabulary.

When applied to a specific XML file, the document to be validated is called the instance document.

## The Limits of DTD

One complaint about DTDs is their lack of data types.

DTDs also do not recognize namespaces, so they are not well suited to compound documents in which content from several vocabularies needs to be validated.
_XML Schemas fully support the Namespace Recommendation_

## Structure

**DTD:**

```xml
<!ELEMENT e1 ((e2,e3?)+|e4)>
```

**XSD:**

```xml
<element name="e1">
  <complexType>
    <choice>
      <sequence maxOccurs="unbounded">
        <element ref="e2"/>
        <element ref="e3" minOccurs="0"/>
      </sequence>
      <element ref="e4">
    </choice>
  </complexType>
</element>
```
